# Predictive Coding Simulation and Replication Study: Orientation Discrimination and Intelligence

This repository contains two major components of a research project conducted as part of the Berkeley Undergraduate Lab of Psychology & Cognitive Sciences (ULAB) at the University of California, Berkeley.

## Project Overview

1. **Replication Study**  
   Reanalyzed publicly available data to replicate prior findings suggesting a strong inverse relationship between visual orientation discrimination ability (measured via Just Noticeable Difference, JND) and intelligence (measured via WASI-II subtests).

2. **Extension Study: Predictive Coding Simulation**  
   Developed a computational predictive coding model simulating individual learning dynamics across sensory and cognitive domains. Virtual participants were assigned separate sensory and cognitive precision parameters affecting prediction error minimization over trials.

## Files

- `ulab_replication_orientation_discrimination.ipynb` — Replication analysis using real data, examining the relationship between JND and IQ scores.
- `predictivecodingsimulation.ipynb` — Extension simulation modeling predictive coding learning processes and generating synthetic JND and IQ measures.

## How to Run

Both notebooks can be opened and run in Google Colab or a local Jupyter environment.

Dependencies:
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `scipy`
- (optional for plotting enhancements: `seaborn`)


Install using pip if necessary:
```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib scipy
```
